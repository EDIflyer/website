We're pleased to announce the release of [YOURLS 1.9.2](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/releases/tag/1.9.2)!

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

Some new features, improvements, and bug fixes that make YOURLS even better than before, obviously :)

Most importantly, YOURLS 1.9.2 now supports **PHP 8.2**, which means you can take advantage of the most recent enhancements in PHP.

We've fixed several bugs that could cause issues with your YOURLS installation, including problems with bookmarklets, unwanted cookies, and various cosmetic issues in the admin interface.

You will find the full list of changes in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

For this release, I would like to thank all the contributors who helped make YOURLS better: @barryhughes, @nexxai, @SXN31, @jarebear6expepjozn6rakjq5iczi3irqwphcvb, @4BRobby, along with the usual crew @ozh, @LeoColomb and @dgw.

# More goodness: the website

The [YOURLS website](https://yourls.org/) has been completely redesigned : under the same domain you'll find the [documentation](https://yourls.org/docs/), the [blog](https://yourls.org/blog/), all powered by simple markdown files hosted on Github ([YOURLS/website](https://github.com/YOURLS/website/)) and a static site generator.

Benefits: faster page loads, extensive search feature, and everyone can contribute with a simple pull request!

## How to update to YOURLS 1.9.2?

Once again, it's your typical case of "upload files over older ones and forget", and as always it won't affect your plugins or user config.

And as always, if it's been a long time since your last DB backup, now would be a good time to do it ;)

## Spread the word!
